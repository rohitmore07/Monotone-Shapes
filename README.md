## Features:

```bash
npm install monotone-shapes
```

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/monotone-shapes@1.0.0/src/app.js"></script>
```

then import using:

```js
import "monotone-shapes";
```

## Usage:

Simply use as web components:

```html
<monotone-shape shape-id="" text=""></monotone-shape>
<monotone-shape shape-id="1" text=""></monotone-shape>
<monotone-shape shape-id="" text="Some cool text"></monotone-shape>
```

It takes in the shape number or any string as an input, which then shows up the given shape as an svg. If shape id (any number between 1 to 24 is given), it will show the SVG at that number. For string input in text attribute, it will generate a value from the given text and always show the same SVG for the same text.

> ‚ùó Note: If both shape-id and text are given, text has the preference.
